# ASK GIT

## COMMAND LINE TOOL

Ask Git is a command line tool that interpretes git commands without leaving the terminal. Write your git command, pass it ask git and it will interprete what the command will perform on your file or directory as well as the result.

Want to Write a command but not sure what the outcome will be? then ask git!!!

## USAGE

To use, install globally by using

```bash

npm install -g askgit

or

yarn global add askgit

```

Then in your terminal, you can used askgit by simply running it directly, like so:

```bash
askgit git commit -m "adds login feature"

```

That's all!!!

askgit will output the results of the git command, with your personalized options in mind.

NB: More Git commands are being added everytime, and they are worded in a much less technical and beginner friendly manner.
